# Proof Sphere  

**Build a Web3 dApp on Arbitrum using zkVerify integration for zero-knowledge proof verification and Arbitrum Stylus smart contracts.**  

## 🚀 Project Overview  

Proof Sphere is a Web3 dApp that enables users to submit, verify, and track zero-knowledge proofs on the **Arbitrum** network using **zkVerify**. It includes:  

- ✅ A user-friendly frontend UI with a clean and intuitive dashboard.  
- ✅ Backend APIs to handle proof submission, verification, and smart contract interaction.  
- ✅ Rust-based smart contracts on Arbitrum Stylus for proof verification.  
- ✅ Fully automated deployment for frontend, backend, and smart contracts.  

## 🏗 Features  

✔ **Proof Submission & Verification** - Users can submit proofs and check their verification status.  
✔ **Wallet Integration** - Supports MetaMask and other wallets via Web3Modal.  
✔ **Rust-based Smart Contracts** - Uses Arbitrum Stylus for efficient proof verification.  
✔ **Modern UI** - Built with **Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN components**.  
✔ **Workflow Automation** - Deploy smart contracts and frontend with **Hardhat, Vercel, and Docker**.
